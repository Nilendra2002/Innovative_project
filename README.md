Project Name:- Smart Wifi DoorBell

Description:-
The Smart WiFi Doorbell project aims to create an advanced doorbell system using the ESP32 CAM module and an FTDI programming board. This system not only functions as a traditional doorbell but also offers enhanced security and convenience through its WiFi connectivity and smart features. The doorbell captures video footage of visitors and streams it to the homeowner's mobile device in real-time, allowing them to see and communicate with visitors from anywhere.

Key Features:
Real-Time Video Streaming: Uses the ESP32 CAM module to capture and stream live video footage to a connected mobile device via WiFi.
Motion Detection: The doorbell can detect motion and alert the homeowner of any activity at their doorstep, enhancing security.
Two-Way Audio: Allows homeowners to communicate with visitors through a built-in microphone and speaker.
Mobile Notifications: Sends push notifications to the homeowner's mobile device when someone rings the doorbell or when motion is detected.
Future Enhancement:
Attendance-Based Feature: In the future, the doorbell will be upgraded to include an attendance-based system. This feature will use facial recognition to identify and log entries and exits of individuals, making it suitable for use in settings such as schools, offices, or residential complexes. The system will maintain a record of attendance, providing detailed reports of who accessed the premises and when.
This project not only enhances home security but also introduces a smart, automated attendance tracking solution, making it a versatile and valuable addition to modern smart home systems.
